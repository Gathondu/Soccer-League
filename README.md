# Soccer-League
This is a soccer league program the divides players into equal number of teams with all teams having equal number
of experienced and inexperienced players.

The players are stored in a csv file which the program reads from.

It outputs a teams.txt which is where the sorted teams are saved and also makes a dir named "Letters" which is where letters of 
individual players are stored addressed to their gurdians.
